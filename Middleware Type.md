**Application Level Middleware**
Imagine you're at a restaurant, and you want to place an order. The waiter takes your order, passes it to the kitchen, and then brings the prepared dish back to you. Now, let's add an application-level middleware equivalent:

`Request Processing` : You tell the waiter your order (**HTTP request**).

`Middleware` : Before the order reaches the kitchen, a chef (**middleware**) might add some special spices or customize the dish based on your preferences. This chef is the **application-level middleware**, modifying or enhancing the order.

`Response Generation` : The customized order is prepared in the kitchen and brought back to you (**HTTP response**).
